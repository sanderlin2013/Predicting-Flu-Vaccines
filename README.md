# Predicting Flu Vaccine Compliance
##Overview

In 2009 the CDC gathered information on vaccine compliance in the U.S. using the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey. They now want to pull out the **most useful features** from this model in order to later create **a new survey** on compliance with COVID-19 vaccines.
