    "Whether the survey respondent received the **seasonal flu vaccine**\n",
    "- Predictive question - who is likely (and unlikely) to recieve the seasonal flu vaccine?\n",
    "Data: National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey (telephone surveys) \n",
    "\n",
    "### Random rachel thoughts\n",
    " - telephone surveys may no longer be the best way to collect this data? Too many spam callers\n",
    " - whenever we talk about vaccine compliance, it is also important to mention the anti-vaxx movement which is a portion of the population who have stated they will not get vaccines- something we won't address here\n",
    " - I chose to look at the seasonal flu instead of the H1N1 flu, because with the current covid vaccine I feel that we have moved into a stage of more routine vaccinations (like the seasonal flu) vrs. vaccinations due to a specific, but eventually fading concern (H1N1). H1N1 came onto the scene in 2009, when this survey was taken, so it is a good indicator of who does and doesn't vaccinate when there is a 'break out'. \n",
